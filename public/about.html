<p>Did you not plan for this contingency? I mean the Starship Enterprise had a self-destruct button. I'm just saying. Yeah, you do seem to have a little 'shit creek' action going. Hey, nobody appreciates a passionate woman more than I do. But uh, in this business... and Walt can back me up on this... the uh, number one rule is, don't take things personally.  </p>

<p>Drum roll, please. Wait for it. Lazer tag. Lazer tag! 7,000 square feet of rollicking fun in the heart of northern Bernalillo County! It adds up perfectly. Walt's a scientist, scientists love lazers. Plus, they got bumper boats, so... </p> 

<p>Yeah! Attorney-client privilege. I mean, that's a big one. That's something I provide for you. If I give up Pinkman, well, then you're gonna be asking, 'Ol' Saul gives 'em up pretty easy. What's to keep him from giving me up?' Y'see, so, then where's the trust? </p>

<p>You want your criminal associate taken into police custody? We declare just enough so as to not arouse suspicion, so Walt's one time winnings becomes seed money for an investment. If you're committed enough, you can make any story work. I once told a woman I was Kevin Costner, and it worked because I believed it.</p>
